#Solid Principles
 **Once upon a time in the world of code...**

Are you ready to dive into an inspiring story about Uncle Bob?  
Uncle Bob, a true legend in the world of **Clean Code** (and donâ€™t worry if youâ€™re new to it â€” weâ€™re on this journey together!), believed that code should be as clean and beautiful as a well-crafted masterpiece. ðŸŽ¨ðŸ’»

In the year 2000, he published a groundbreaking article titled **"Design Principles and Design Patterns."**  
In this article, he emphasized a powerful message: **Software must be maintainable, flexible, and ready for change** â€” just like a living organism adapting to its environment. ðŸŒ±âœ¨

From these insights, Uncle Bob crafted a golden formula â€” a collection of best practices to build strong, elegant software.  
He called it **SOLID**.

**What is SOLID?**  
It's not just a word; it's a **philosophy**.  
An acronym formed from **five fundamental design principles** that guide developers toward writing robust and scalable code.
