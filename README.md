Solid Principles
 **Once upon a time in the world of code...**

Are you ready to dive into an inspiring story about Uncle Bob?  
Uncle Bob, a true legend in the world of **Clean Code** (and don’t worry if you’re new to it — we’re on this journey together!), believed that code should be as clean and beautiful as a well-crafted masterpiece. 

In the year 2000, he published a groundbreaking article titled **"Design Principles and Design Patterns."**  
In this article, he emphasized a powerful message: **Software must be maintainable, flexible, and ready for change** — just like a living organism adapting to its environment. 

From these insights, Uncle Bob crafted a golden formula — a collection of best practices to build strong, elegant software.  
He called it **SOLID**.

**What is SOLID?**  
It's not just a word; it's a **philosophy**.  
An acronym formed from **five fundamental design principles** that guide developers toward writing robust and scalable code.
Let's break down these five principles:
S : Single Responsipility Principle which say "any class should have one reson to change " or "a class should do on job", it aims to ensure that a class is not overly complex and has a single well defined purpose.
O : Open/Closed Principle which say "a class should be open for extention closed for modification",add new functionlity without modifing the existing code.
L : Liskovs Substitutions Principle say "child class must be subsititionable for their parent ,ensure that inherretance is used correctly and the subclass are true subsutable.
I : Interface Segregation Principle say "do not force any client to implenent an interface which is irrelevent to them",are designed to meet the needs of specific clients,making them more flexible.
D : Debendency inversion principle say "high level class shouldnot depand on low level class both of them shoud depand on abstraction ,foucse on decoupling dependecies between module ,making the system more flexiable and maintainable.
