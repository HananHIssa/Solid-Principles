# ðŸ“š SOLID Principles â€” Learn and Apply

ðŸŒŸ **Once upon a time in the world of code...**

Are you ready to dive into an inspiring story about Uncle Bob?  
Uncle Bob, a true legend in the world of **Clean Code** (and donâ€™t worry if youâ€™re new to it â€” weâ€™re on this journey together!), believed that code should be as clean and beautiful as a well-crafted masterpiece. 

In the year 2000, he published a groundbreaking article titled **"Design Principles and Design Patterns."**  
In this article, he emphasized a powerful message:  
**Software must be maintainable, flexible, and ready for change** â€” just like a living organism adapting to its environment. ðŸŒ±âœ¨

From these insights, Uncle Bob crafted a golden formula â€” a collection of best practices to build strong, elegant software.  
He called it **SOLID**.

## âœ¨ What is SOLID?

It's not just a word; it's a **philosophy** â€”  
An acronym formed from **five fundamental design principles** that guide developers toward writing robust and scalable code.

Let's break them down:

---

### ðŸ§© S â€” Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
> "A class should have only one reason to change."  
Each class should focus on one job only, making it simple and well-organized.

---

### ðŸ§© O â€” Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
> "Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification."  
You can add new features without altering the existing working code.

---

### ðŸ§© L â€” Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
> "Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types."  
Inheritance should be used correctly so that child classes behave like their parent classes without issues.

---

### ðŸ§© I â€” Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
> "Do not force any client to depend on interfaces it does not use."  
Keep interfaces focused and avoid making classes implement irrelevant methods.

---

### ðŸ§© D â€” Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
> "High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions."  
This promotes decoupling, making the system more flexible and maintainable.

## ðŸ§ª Unit Testing

If you are interested in testing (just like me!), I have uploaded simple **unit tests** for each principle example above.  
Feel free to check them and practice!

## ðŸŒŸ Bonus: What Else I Learned During SOLID Study

During my SOLID principles study, I explored another important OOP concept called **Polymorphism**. Here's a short explanation:

---

### ðŸ”¹ What is Polymorphism?

Polymorphism means calling child classes through their parent class reference and deciding **which child** at:
- **Runtime**: (Dynamic Method Overriding)
- **Compile Time**: (Static Method Overloading)

Letâ€™s dive deeper:

---

### ðŸ”¸ Dynamic Method Overriding
- **Definition:** The child class is selected during the program execution based on the object's type.
- **Inheritance is required.**
- **Example:**
```java
abstract class Animal {
    public abstract void sound();
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Meow");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal = new Dog();
        animal.sound(); // Output: Bark
    }
}
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ Static Method Overloading
- **Definition:** The method is selected during **compile time** based on the method's signature (parameters).
- **Inheritance is not required.**
- **Example:**
```java
public class Calculator {
    public static int add(int number1, int number2) {
        return number1 + number2;
    }

    public static int add(int number1, int number2, int number3) {
        return number1 + number2 + number3;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(add(1, 2));     // Output: 3
        System.out.println(add(1, 2, 3));  // Output: 6
    }
}
```

---

âœ… **Summary:**
- **Dynamic Overriding** = Decision during runtime (requires inheritance).
- **Static Overloading** = Decision during compile time (no inheritance needed).
