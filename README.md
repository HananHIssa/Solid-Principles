# 🚀 SOLID Principles

🌟 **Once upon a time in the world of code...**

Are you ready to dive into an inspiring story about Uncle Bob?  
Uncle Bob, a true legend in the world of **Clean Code** (and don’t worry if you’re new to it — we’re on this journey together!), believed that code should be as clean and beautiful as a well-crafted masterpiece. 🎨💻

In the year 2000, he published a groundbreaking article titled **_"Design Principles and Design Patterns."_**  
In this article, he emphasized a powerful message:  
> **"Software must be maintainable, flexible, and ready for change — just like a living organism adapting to its environment."** 🌱✨

From these insights, Uncle Bob crafted a golden formula — a collection of best practices to build strong, elegant software.  
He called it **SOLID**.

## 📚 What is SOLID?

It's not just a word; it's a **philosophy** — an acronym formed from **five fundamental design principles** that guide developers toward writing robust and scalable code.

Let's break down these five principles:

---

## 🧩 Principles Breakdown

### **S**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

> **"A class should have only one reason to change"**  
> _A class should do one job, keeping it focused and easier to maintain._

---

### **O**: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

> **"A class should be open for extension but closed for modification."**  
> _You can add new functionality without modifying existing code._

---

### **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

> **"Child classes must be substitutable for their parent classes."**  
> _Subclasses should behave like their parent classes without unexpected behavior._

---

### **I**: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

> **"Do not force any client to implement an interface that is irrelevant to them."**  
> _Clients should not be burdened with methods they do not use._

---

### **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

> **"High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions."**  
> _Decoupling dependencies makes the system more flexible and maintainable._

## 🛠️ Additional Note

If you need to understand more clearly, take a quick look at the examples provided above.  
And if you are interested in testing, just like me, I have uploaded simple unit testing examples for each principle. 📈
